I've successfully created Infrastructure as Code strategies, containerized microservices, and built Kubernetes clusters that support critical business operations. My experience designing CI/CD pipelines following DRY modular patterns and creating platform automation for ephemeral sandboxes directly aligns with modern DevOps practices that drive business value.

Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered measurable results:

- **Technical Innovation**: Pioneered the adoption of modern DevOps tools and practices across multiple organizations, including Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, OpenTofu, and comprehensive CI/CD pipelines
- **Security & Compliance**: Integrated SecOps patterns and security scanning into development workflows, ensuring robust and compliant infrastructure

My technical expertise spans the full DevOps ecosystem, including Kubernetes orchestration, Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and OpenTofu, containerization with Docker, and comprehensive monitoring and observability solutions. I hold multiple industry certifications, including CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) and AWS Professional-level certifications that validate my deep technical knowledge.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge technical excellence with business value. I have experience collaborating with cross-functional teams, from marketing on customer trials to engineering teams on modernization initiatives. My background in both hands-on technical work and team leadership positions me well to contribute immediately while growing with your organization.
